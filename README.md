### **Key Deliverables:**

* **Actionable Business Recommendations** derived from sales data.
* **Regional Performance Segmentation** (Canada, U.S., Australia).
* **Demographic Sales Insights** (Age and Gender targeting).
* **Product Performance and Seasonal Demand** forecasting metrics.

# 💡 Problem Statement & Rationale 

### **Scenario Overview**
BikeGear Solutions operates across Canada, the U.S., and Australia. Without a clear data-driven view of its highest-performing segments, the company risked misallocating resources and missing critical growth opportunities due to operational inefficiencies and poorly timed campaigns.

### **Rationale for the Project (Business Impact)**
 
 The core problem was the **lack of alignment** between business strategy (marketing, inventory, and promotions) and actual customer behavior and sales pattern

| Impact Area | Importance to the Business |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Optimization** | Pinpoints top-performing regions and product subcategories to focus promotional efforts and pricing strategies, maximizing profitability. |
| **Customer Targeting** | Identifies core age groups and demographics driving sales, supporting targeted advertising and future product design. |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Provides evidence to improve supply chain responsiveness and reduce inventory waste by accurately predicting seasonal demand spikes. |

The analysis of the sales data was conducted using Excel Pivot Tables and Calculated Fields to transform raw data (Unit_Cost, Unit_Price, Order_Quantity) into the derived metrics (Revenue, Cost, Profit) that drive actionable insights. The results are visualized through a dynamic dashboard

##  Solution to Business Questions

As the Business Analyst, I utilized **Microsoft Excel** to clean the data, create calculated metrics (**Profit** and **Revenue**), segment customer groups, and build a dynamic, interactive dashboard to address these questions and provide clear, actionable strategic recommendations.

### 1) Revenue Distribution by Region: Top countries (by revenue):

- United States — 30,574,297 (≈ 32.36% of total revenue)

- Australia — 25,297,064 (≈ 26.77%)

- United Kingdom — 11,009,158 (≈ 11.65%)

- Germany — 9,859,672 (≈ 10.43%)

- France — 9,768,215 (≈ 10.34%)

- Top states/provinces (by revenue) include California (top), England, New South Wales, Washington, etc. (California is the single highest state contributor).

### Implication & Recommendation

- Prioritise targeted promotional campaigns (e.g., paid-search and local social advertising) in California and major US hubs, and in top Australian states (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland).

- For underperforming states/countries with decent traffic but low conversions, run A/B tests on localised landing pages and offers.

### 2) Which age groups does our product mostly appeal to?

Grouping used (explicit boundaries used in analysis): Youth = <= 24 | Young Adult = 25–35 | Adult = > 35

- Adult (>35) is the dominant group by both revenue and volume (largest share of revenue and orders).

- Young Adult is the next largest; Youth contributes smaller share but is still meaningful for accessories/entry-level items.

### Implication & Recommendation: 

- Focus premium products, upsells, and extended-warranty messaging to Adults (>35).

- Use social channels and promotional bundles (student/entry-level pricing) to grow adoption among Youths.

- Tailor creative by age: lifestyle-focused imagery for Adults; mobile-first, value-oriented creatives for Young Adults and Youth.

### 3) Product Popularity (subcategories)

- Top product subcategories by units sold (and their revenue) are dominated by Bike Racks

### Implication & Recommendation

- Increase inventory & promotional emphasis on top-selling subcategories (e.g., “Hitch Rack - 4-Bike” family).

- Remove or markdown slow-moving SKUs; consider bundle promotions pairing accessories with racks to increase average order value.

### 4) Sales Seasonality
   
- Monthly revenue patterns show consistent peaks in December, June, and May this is likely due to holiday and cycling season effects.

- Lower revenue months: July and some early autumn months.

### Implication & Recommendation

- Increase stock levels for top SKUs before May–June and the December holiday window.

- Schedule major promotions in April–June and November–December to align with demand peaks.

- For low-season months, execute smaller, targeted promos to smooth demand and reduce inventory holding costs.

# Conclusion

## Strategic Recommendations (priority list)

- Regional campaigns: Launch paid and email campaigns targeted to California, New South Wales, and other top states. Create localized landing pages and measure lift.

- Inventory planning: Rebalance inventory to ensure top subcategories and specific SKUs are well stocked before May–June and Nov–Dec.

- Age-tailored promotions: Promote premium bundles and warranty extras to Adults (>35); run entry-level discount bundles targeting Youth.

- Product focus & merchandising: Promote top subcategories on homepage and checkout cross-sell; discontinue/markdown slow-moving SKUs.

- Seasonal promotions calendar: Build a marketing calendar around May–June and November–December peaks
