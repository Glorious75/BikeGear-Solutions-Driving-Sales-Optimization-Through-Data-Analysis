# 🎯 Project Summary & Challenge 

BikeGear Solutions, a multinational retailer of cycling accessories, faced significant strategic blind spots regarding its global sales performance. Leadership required data to effectively refine **regional marketing strategies, understand target demographics, manage inventory, and forecast demand**.

This project utilized **MS Excel** for a deep-dive analysis of historical sales data to provide actionable intelligence, addressing key questions like: *Which regions and demographics are driving the highest revenue?* and *How do we align inventory with seasonal demand cycles?*

### **Key Deliverables:**

* **Actionable Business Recommendations** derived from sales data.
* **Regional Performance Segmentation** (Canada, U.S., Australia).
* **Demographic Sales Insights** (Age and Gender targeting).
* **Product Performance and Seasonal Demand** forecasting metrics.

# 💡 Problem Statement & Rationale 

### **Scenario Overview**
BikeGear Solutions operates across Canada, the U.S., and Australia. Without a clear data-driven view of its highest-performing segments, the company risked misallocating resources and missing critical growth opportunities due to operational inefficiencies and poorly timed campaigns.

### **Rationale for the Project (Business Impact)**
 
 The core problem was the **lack of alignment** between business strategy (marketing, inventory, and promotions) and actual customer behavior and sales pattern

| Impact Area | Importance to the Business |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Optimization** | Pinpoints top-performing regions and product subcategories to focus promotional efforts and pricing strategies, maximizing profitability. |
| **Customer Targeting** | Identifies core age groups and demographics driving sales, supporting targeted advertising and future product design. |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Provides evidence to improve supply chain responsiveness and reduce inventory waste by accurately predicting seasonal demand spikes. |

# 🛠️ Tools and Technology 

| Category | Tool / Feature | Application in Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Analysis** | MS Excel (Pivot Tables & Slicers) | Aggregating and dynamically filtering sales data by region, age, and product. |
| **Visualization** | Excel Charts (Bar, Line, Pareto) | Creating clear visuals for regional scorecards and seasonal trends (e.g., Line Chart for monthly sales). |
| **Calculations** | Advanced Formulas (e.g., `SUMIFS`) | Calculating metrics like Revenue per Region and Average Order Value (AOV). |

# 📊 Data Description 

 The analysis of the sales data was conducted using Excel Pivot Tables and Calculated Fields to transform raw data (Unit_Cost, Unit_Price, Order_Quantity) into the derived metrics (Revenue, Cost, Profit) that drive actionable insights. The results are visualized through a dynamic dashboard

**Dataset:** `BikeGear_Solutions_sales_data.xlsx`

###  Solution

As the Business Analyst, I utilized **Microsoft Excel** to clean the data, create calculated metrics (**Profit** and **Revenue**), segment customer groups, and build a dynamic, interactive dashboard to address these questions and provide clear, actionable strategic recommendations.



# 🧠 Project Learning Opportunities 

This project demonstrated proficiency in leveraging raw data to solve real-world business challenges and transition analysis into actionable strategy.

* **Data Transformation:** Successfully created derived metrics (`Profit`, `Revenue`) and implemented custom segmentation logic (e.g., Age Groups) critical for business modeling.
* **Strategic Reporting:** Developed a dynamic Excel dashboard that consolidates complex data into clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visual analysis for executive review.
* **Business Acumen:** Provided clear recommendations that directly impact **inventory planning** (based on seasonality), **marketing focus** (based on region/demographic), and **product strategy** (maximizing high-profit items).
* **Core Conclusion:** Identified that while **Tires and Tubes** drive volume, **Bikes** drive the overwhelming majority of profit, necessitating a change in promotional focus.
